CodeBook.md - contains description of what the analysis code does and some descriptions around the variables used.

run_analysis.R - contains the code that cleans up the project data into a finalData.csv file.
The code does the following:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
